# Hi, I'm Zulfian 👋

**Python GTK App Dev | Creator of Jollpi Text Editor | Architect of MUN-AI | Linux Enthusiast | Full Stack Laravel**

---

I’m a **full-stack developer** currently working at a Civil Registration Office, where I serve as a Database Administrator. While the role isn’t always technical, I’ve developed and maintained internal Laravel + MySQL applications to support various administrative workflows.

Earlier, I spent some time in the banking sector — not in a tech position, but the experience strengthened my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving mindset.

Back in university, I spent countless hours exploring Linux and building desktop tools with **Python**. I learned Linux from thick Slackware PDFs, experimented with Mandriva, Debian, and Backtrack on a modest 2 GB RAM laptop, and built a **Python + GTK** text editor called **Jollpi** as my final project. That experience shaped how I think about software: practical, efficient, and transparent. I’ve been a Linux (Manjaro) user ever since. 

Today, I’m rebuilding **Jollpi** Text Editor from the ground up using **Python 3, GTK 4, and GtkSourceView 5**, keeping the same lightweight and native spirit but with a modern foundation.

Alongside that, I’m developing MUN-AI (Machine Understanding for Neutralization) — an offline AI orchestration proof-of-concept using Ollama with a Python GTK 4 UI, powered by Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Unlike typical monolithic AI apps, MUN-AI follows a modular architecture: the model runs separately in a Podman container, while the UI performs analysis locally. This approach keeps the process transparent, verifiable, and flexible — and opens possibilities beyond data science, such as edge AI or distributed autonomous systems.

🚀 **Currently expanding my skills and open to exploring new opportunities where I can contribute and grow further.**

## 📈 Recent Projects
- **MUN-AI** (Machine Understanding for Neutralization)     
  A proof-of-concept for offline AI orchestration using **Ollama** and a **Python GTK 4** UI. It integrates **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data analysis, featuring a modular architecture where the model runs in a **Podman** container while analytics execute locally — enabling transparency, flexibility, and efficiency for edge or research environments.
- **Jollpi 3.0**     
  A modern rebuild of my old college project — a native **Python + GTK 4** text editor using **GtkSourceView 5**. Designed for simplicity and responsiveness, with async I/O, per-tab file monitoring, and a lightweight UI, modern GTK interface.
- **Birth Registration System (Web & Desktop version)**     
  A web-based application for digital birth registration system designed for used by health facilities and civil registration offices. Built with **Laravel** and **MySQL**. A desktop version (Electron-based) was also explored as an alternative deployment option.
- **Marriage Registration Information System**     
  A web-based application for digital marriage registration, designed for used by place of worship and civil registration offices. Built with **Laravel** and **MySQL**.
- **Jollpi**     
  Jollpi is a lightweight, tab-based text editor built with **Python + GTK 2 + GtkSourceView2** for Linux Desktop, originally developed as my final college project.
